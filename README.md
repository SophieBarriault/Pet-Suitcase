<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- **Why did you make this project?** 

  + Because I've always wanted to make my own terrarium, and I specifically wanted to make one that simulates a rainforest. 

- **What was your source of inspiration for this project?** 

  + My sources of inspiration are the various raining rainforest terrariums and waterfall terrariums I saw people making online, as well as the Cloud Rainforest in Costa Rica.
